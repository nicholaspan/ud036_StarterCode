## Description
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

This package allows user to define a list of movie objects which are then displayed in a movie trailer website.

## Usage
Use the entertainment_center.py file to instantiate your movie objects for your favorite movies, then define a list of these movies in variable "movies".

fresh_tomatoes.py does most of the work for you, creating an html webpage and pulling the movies list defined previously.
